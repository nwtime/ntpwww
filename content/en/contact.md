The primary sources of assistance for NTP users are the [documentation](/documentation/4.2.8-series/) and information on this website, the [mailing lists](https://lists.ntp.org/), and the [FAQ](/ntpfaq/).

The official NTP IRC channel is **#ntp** on the [Libera IRC network](https://libera.chat/). When posting configuration files or command output on IRC, please use [pastebin.com](https://pastebin.com/) or a similar service. Libera provides [IRC usage instructions](https://libera.chat/guides/) as well as a [webchat](https://web.libera.chat/) for those who prefer to use a web browser instead of an IRC client.

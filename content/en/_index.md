NTP is a protocol designed to synchronize the clocks of computers over a network to a common timebase. The NTP Project produces a software reference implementation of the NTP protocol standard, maintains the implementation documentation, and develops the protocol standard that is used to communicate time between systems. The software and protocol specifications produced by the NTP Project keep the clocks right on tens of millions of computers around the world. 

The Network Time Foundation provides support for the NTP Project and hosts the [IETF NTP Working Group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ntp/about/). Learn more about the Foundation's work at https://www.nwtime.org.

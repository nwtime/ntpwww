#### Synopsis

**Address:** <code>127.127.12._u_</code>
: **Reference ID:** `IRIG`
: **Driver ID:** `IRIG_TPRO`
: **TPRO Device:** <code>/dev/tpro*u*</code>
: **Requires:** KSI/Odetics device driver, `/usr/include/sys/tpro.h` header file

#### Description

This driver supports the KSI/Odetics TPRO and TPRO-SAT IRIG-B Decoder, which is a module connected directly to the SBus of a Sun workstation. The module works with the IRIG-B signal generated by several radio clocks, including those made by Arbiter, Austron, Odetics, Spectracom and TrueTime, among others, although it is generally an add-on option. In the case of the TPRO-SAT, the module is an integral part of a GPS receiver, which serves as the primary timing source.

Using the TPRO interface as a NTP reference clock provides precision time only to `ntpd` and its clients. With suitable kernel modifications, it is possible to use the TPRO as the CPU system clock, avoiding errors introduced by the CPU clock oscillator wander. See the [A Kernel Model for Precision Timekeeping](/archives/4.2.8-series/kern/) page for further details.

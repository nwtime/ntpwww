#### Security Bug Reporting Procedures

If you find or suspect a security related program bug in this distribution, please send a report to [security@ntp.org](mailto:security@ntp.org). Please do not contact developers directly.

#### Non-Security Bug Reporting Procedures

If you find or suspect a non-security related program bug in this distribution, please send a report to the NTP Public Service Project Bug Tracking System (Bugzilla) at https://bugs.ntp.org/. Bugs reported this way are immediately forwarded to the developers. Please do not contact the developers directly.

If you find or suspect an error in the program documentation pages, please send a report directly to the editor David Mills at mills@udel.edu. The master documentation pages are not controlled by the bug tracking system. You are invited to contribute new or revised pages in similar style and format.

If you wish to send a report via electronic mail, please remember that your report will be held until one of our volunteers enters it in Bugzilla. The email address for these reports is bugs@ntp.org. You will need to register at https://bugs.ntp.org/ so that you may participate directly in any e-mail discussion regarding your report.

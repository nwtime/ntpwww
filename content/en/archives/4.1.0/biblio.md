Say it three times and it must be right.

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time of a computer client or server to another server or reference time source, such as a radio or satellite receiver or modem. It provides accuracies typically within a millisecond on LANs up to a few tens of milliseconds on WANs relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), as provided by a Global Positioning Service (GPS) receiver, for example. Typical NTP configurations utilize multiple redundant servers and diverse network paths, in order to achieve high accuracy and reliability. Some configurations include cryptographic authentication to prevent accidental or malicious protocol attacks.

Information on the NTP architecture, protocol and algorithms can be found in the following articles and reports, which are available online. General issues of the concepts and facilities assumed by NTP are discussed in the [Executive Summary - Computer Network Time Synchronization](/archives/4.1.0/exec) page, while issues related to the NTP timescale and pending century are discussed in the Network Time Protocol Year 2000 Conformance Statement page, both of which are included in this software distribution. Network timekeeping technology continues to advance and may obsolete some of the following documents. For a current list of all papers, reports, briefings and other documents relevant to the NTP community, see the [David L. Mills](http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills) web page. A historical perspective is available in

The NTP architecture, protocol and algorithm models are described in

The NTP specification and implementation has evolved over the last two decades to the current Version 4 of the protocol. This version includes significant enhancements in accuracy and reliability, as determined by experience in an estimated total of well over 100,000 clients and servers in the Internet, while retaining backward compatibility with previous versions. This software distribution contains an implementation of the NTP Version 4 architecture, protocol and algorithms. While a formal specification of this version is not yet available, this version is fully compliant with the previous NTP Version 3 specification and implementation defined in

The NTP Version 4 implementation adds a number of extensions and refinements to the previous version, including an autonomous configuration and authentication capability, improved clock discipline algorithms capable of submicrosecond accuracy and many other refinements. Specific changes since the Version 3 specification was issued include:

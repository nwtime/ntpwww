The NTP implementation documentation for all software versions from 1998 (NTP version 3.5.93e) to the present (NTP version 4.2.8p15) is available from the Documentation drop-down menu.

Most software versions represent a series of patch levels. The landing page for each series has a table showing all patch levels for that series, including release dates and links to release announcements. The documentation for a series applies to all patch levels for that series, unless specified otherwise.

**To ensure your system is patched against all known vulnerabilities and has the latest features and bug fixes applied, it is recommended to use the latest series (4.2.8-series) and patch level (p15).**

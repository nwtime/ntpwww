NTP users are strongly urged to [implement Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page) to ensure that their NTP daemon is not susceptible to use in a [reflected denial-of-service (DRDoS) attack](https://doc.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/ntpbug1532/). Please see this [Network Time Foundation Post](https://www.nwtime.org/news/ntp-winter-2013-network-drdos-attacks/) for more information.

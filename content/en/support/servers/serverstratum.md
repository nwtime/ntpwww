The time server stratum is the position at which a time server operates in the NTP hierarchy.

A stratum 1 time is directly connected to a reference clock and is at the top of the time server hierarchy.

A stratum 2 time server receives the time from one, or more, stratum 1 time servers. Stratum 2 time servers are not significantly less accurate than stratum 1 time servers.

> Use the `Inactive` option of Server Stratum to mark a [Time Server](/support/servers/timeserver) as Inactive.

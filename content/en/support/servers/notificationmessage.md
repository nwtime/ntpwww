Time Server operators which **require** a client to send a Notification Message prior to use must set the [Access Policy](/support/servers/accesspolicy/) to [Restricted Access](/support/servers/restrictedaccess/).

When this option is set to `Yes` in a Time Server's list entry, clients should send an email to the Server Contact announcing their intent to use the Time Server.

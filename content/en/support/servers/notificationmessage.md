An e-mail message to a [Time Server](/support/servers/timeserver) admin announcing your intent to use their server.

If you require a Notification Message you must set your [Access Policy](/support/servers/accesspolicy) to [Restricted Access](/support/servers/restrictedaccess).

You should send a Notification Message to the [Time Server](/support/servers/timeserver) admin if this option is set to `Yes` in that Time Server's list entry.

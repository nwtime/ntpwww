#### Description 

There is a fencepost error in a "recovery branch" of the code for the Oncore GPS receiver if the communication link to the ONCORE is weak / distorted and the decoding doesn't work.

#### Mitigation

* Upgrade to [4.2.8p10 or later.](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/)
* Properly monitor your `ntpd` instances, and auto-restart `ntpd` (without `-g`) if it stops running.

title: "NTP BUG 3012(p12 update): Sybil vulnerability: ephemeral association attack"
description: "If a system is set up to use a trustedkey and is not using the optional 4th field in the ntp.keys file to specify which IPs can serve time, a malicious authenticated peer that knows the private symmetric key can create arbitrarily-many ephemeral associations in order to win the clock selection of ntpd and modify a victimâ€™s clock. The resolution for this bug was improved in NTP 4.2.8p12."

#### Description 

`ntpd` can be vulnerable to Sybil attacks. If a system is set up to use a trustedkey and if one is not using the feature introduced in ntp-4.2.8p6 allowing an optional 4th field in the `ntp.keys` file to specify which IPs can serve time, a malicious authenticated peer -- i.e. one where the attacker knows the private symmetric key -- can create arbitrarily-many ephemeral associations in order to win the clock selection of `ntpd` and modify a victim's clock. Two additional protections are offered in ntp-4.2.8p11. One is the `noepeer` directive, which disables symmetric passive ephemeral peering. The other extends the functionality of the 4th field in the `ntp.keys` file to include specifying a subnet range. 

* * *
    
#### Mitigation

* Implement [BCP-38](http://bcp38.info/).
* Upgrade to [4.2.8p12 or later](/downloads/).
* Use the `noepeer` directive to prohibit symmetric passive ephemeral associations.
* Use the `ippeerlimit` directive to limit the number of peer associations from an IP.
* Use the 4th argument in the `ntp.keys` file to limit the IPs and subnets that can be time servers.
* Properly monitor your `ntpd` instances.

#### Credit

This weakness was originally discovered by Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG. The edge-case hole in the noepeer processing was reported by Martin Burnicki of Meinberg.

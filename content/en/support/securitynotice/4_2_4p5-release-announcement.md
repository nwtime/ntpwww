The NTP Public Services Project is pleased to announce that NTP 4.2.4p5, a Point Release of the NTP Reference Implementation from the NTP Project, is now available.

This release fixes a number of Windows-specific `ntpd` bugs and platform-independent `ntpdate` bugs. A logging bugfix has been applied to the ONCORE driver.

The `dynamic` keyword is now obsolete and deferred binding to local interfaces is the new default. The minimum time restriction for the     
interface update interval has been dropped.                             

A number of minor build system and documentation fixes are included.

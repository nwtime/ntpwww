#### Description 

The fix for [3445](https://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3445) introduced a bug whereby a system that is running ntp-4.2.8p12 or p13 that only has one unauthenticated time source can be attacked in a way that causes the victim's next poll to its source to be delayed, for as long as the attack is maintained.

#### Mitigation

*  Use authentication with symmetric peers.
* Have enough sources of time.
* Upgrade to [4.2.8p14 or later](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/).

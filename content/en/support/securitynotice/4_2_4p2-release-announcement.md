The NTP Public Services Project is pleased to announce that NTP 4.2.4p2, a Point Release of the NTP Reference Implementation from the NTP Project, is now available.

This release fixes a multicast mode authentication problem, an error in NTP packet handling on Windows that could lead to `ntpd` crashing, and several other minor bugs. Handling of multicast interfaces and logging configuration were improved. The required versions of `autogen` and `libopts` were incremented.

In the 1994 report _Unix Kernel Modifications for Precision
Time Synchronization_, David L. Mills  provides a substantial revision of [RFC 1589](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1589.html). It includes several changes to the daemon and user interfaces, as well as a new feature which disciplines the CPU clock oscillator in both time and frequency to a source of precision time signals, as well as provisions to operate with good accuracy at much higher poll intervals in the order of several hours.

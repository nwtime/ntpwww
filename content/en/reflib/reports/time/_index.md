In the 1992 report _Modelling and Analysis of Computer Network Clocks_, David L. Mills describes analytical models and design methodologies for computer clocks synchronized to other clocks in a computer network or internetwork. This requires each clock to function as a disciplined oscillator which can be adjusted in both time and frequency to compensate for the intrinsic errors of the onboard frequency source. It also requires the use of a time-synchronization protocol such as the Network Time Protocol.

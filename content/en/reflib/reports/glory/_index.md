In the 1989 report _Measured Performance of the Network Time Protocol in the DARPA/NSF Internet System_, David L. Mills describes a series of experiments involving over 100,000 hosts of the DARPA/NSF Internet system and located in the U.S., Europe and the Pacific. The experiments are designed to evaluate the availability, accuracy and reliability of international standard time distribution using the DARPA/NSF Internet and the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is designed specifically for use in a large, diverse internet system operating at speeds from mundane to lightwave.

In the 1996 report _Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Version 4 for IPv4, IPv6 and OSI_, David L. Mills describes the Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Version 4, which is an adaptation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) used to synchronize computer clocks in the Internet. SNTP can be used when the ultimate performance of the full NTP implementation is not needed or justified.

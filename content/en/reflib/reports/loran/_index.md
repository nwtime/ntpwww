In the 1992 report _A Computer-Controlled LORAN-C Receiver for Precision Timekeeping_, David L. Mills describes the design and construction of a specialized radio timing receiver for the LORAN-C radionavigation system. It is intended as a laboratory monitor and comparator for precision timekeeping equipment, but also has applications as a precision clock and timing source for computer networks and in other applications requiring precision timekeeping with respect to UTC.

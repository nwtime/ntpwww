In the 2023 memo [Suggestions for Protocol and Security Enhancements for the Network Time Protocol](/reflib/enhancements/suggestions-protocol-and-security-enhancements-ntp/), David L. Mills suggests protocol and security enhancements for the Network Time Protocol (NTP), along with a replacement for the Autokey security scheme.

From the abstract:

*The primary goals in this memo are to improve synchronization accuracy in all protocol modes. Secondary goals include improved resistance to wiretap and middleman attacks that exploit weaknesses in the error detection and recovery procedures.*

*The accuracy and security enhancements proposed in this memo are compatible with the current reference implementation and others in the community. They can be implemented either as incremental changes to the reference implementation or as a standalone replacement.*

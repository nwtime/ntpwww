He covers IPIN issues, architecture, timekeeping models, astronomical timescales, and interplanetary NTP.

In his 2008 brief [Time Transfer in Space](/reflib/brief/ipin/mars.pdf), he discusses time transfer between earth and satellites, the space shuttle, the moon, the Mars orbiter and rovers, as well as the deep space network.

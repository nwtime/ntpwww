In the 2010 brief [Interleaved Synchronization Protocols for LANs and Space Data Links](/reflib/brief/onwire/onwire.pdf), David L. Mills suggests modifications for three time synchronization protocols used on various LANs and space data links. The proposed modifications are for NTP (Internet synchronization), PTP (hardware synchronization), and the Consultive Committee on Space Data Systems (CCSDS) Proximity-1 Time Services Protocol used for Mars space data links.

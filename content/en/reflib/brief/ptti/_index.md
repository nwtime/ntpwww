In his 2003 brief [The Network Computer as Precision Timekeeper](/reflib/brief/ptti/ptti.pdf), David L. Mills describes NTP's improved NTP local clock model.

The 2004 brief [Coping with Overload on the Network Time Protocol Public Servers](/reflib/brief/ptti/ptti04.pdf) provides an overview of incidents experienced at U Wisconsin, USNO, and NIST, and proposes fixes for coping with overloaded NTP servers.

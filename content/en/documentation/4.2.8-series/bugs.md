#### Non-Security Bug Reporting Procedures

If you find or suspect a non-security related program or documentation bug in this distribution, please send a report to the [NTP Public Service Project Bug Tracking System (Bugzilla)](https://bugs.ntp.org/). Bugs reported this way are immediately forwarded to the developers. Please do not contact the developers directly.

If you wish to send a report via electronic mail, please remember that your report will be held until one of our volunteers enters it in Bugzilla. The email address for these reports is [bugs@ntp.org](mailto:bugs@ntp.org). You will need to register at [https://bugs.ntp.org/](https://bugs.ntp.org/) to participate directly in any e-mail discussion regarding your report. If you don't register and we have questions for you we won't be able to make progress on fixing your problem. Please directly register on and use our Bugzilla instance to report issues.

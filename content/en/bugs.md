#### Security Bugs

If you find a security vulnerability in the latest version of NTP, send an email report to [security@ntp.org](mailto:security@ntp.org). The NTP Security Officer will respond to your report.

**Please refrain from discussing potential security issues in public,** including on the news group, bug tracking system, or any mailing lists. Refer to [Security Notices](https://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice) for more information about NTP's security notification policy, security patch policy, instructions for reporting security issues, and a list of recent security vulnerabilities.

#### Software Bugs

To report a non-security related bug in the latest version of NTP, use the [NTP Bug Tracking System (Bugzilla)](https://bugs.ntp.org/). Before creating a bug report, [search](https://bugs.ntp.org/query.cgi) to see if a similar issue has already been reported. If so, there may be a known workaround for resolving the issue.

You do not need to register for an account in order to search for existing bugs. You will need an account with a valid email address in order to [report a bug](https://bugs.ntp.org/enter_bug.cgi). As developers work on your bug report, Bugzilla will notify you as comments are added to your report. See the [FAQ on Reporting Bugs](/ntpfaq/ntp-s-trbl-bug-reports/) for more information about filing a bug report.

#### Documentation Bugs

The source for the NTP implementation documentation, FAQ, reference library, and other pages of this website is in the [ntpwww git repository](https://bitbucket.nwtime.org/projects/WEBSITES/repos/ntpwww/browse). The [README](https://bitbucket.nwtime.org/projects/WEBSITES/repos/ntpwww/browse/README.md) provides instructions for obtaining and building the source as well as how to create a pull request.

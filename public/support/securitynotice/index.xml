This release fixes one security issue in ntpd:
 MEDIUM: 3565: Crafted null dereference attack from a trusted source with an authenticated mode 6 packet  A crafted malicious authenticated mode 6 (ntpq) packet from a permitted network address can trigger a NULL pointer dereference, crashing ntpd. Note that for this attack to work, the sending system must be on an address that the target&amp;rsquo;s ntpd accepts mode 6 packets from, and must properly authenticate the packet with a private key that is specifically listed as being used for mode 6 authorization.</description>

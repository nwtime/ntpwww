<p>NTP keeps precision time by <a href="/ntpfaq/ntp-s-algo/#5161-how-will-ntp-discipline-my-clock">applying small adjustments to system clock periodically</a>. However, some clock implementations do not allow small corrections to be applied to the system clock, and there is no standard interface to monitor the system clock&rsquo;s quality.</p>
<p><a href="/reflib/rfc/rfc1589.txt">RFC 1589</a> defines a clock model with the following features :</p>
<ul>
<li>Two new system calls to query and control the clock: <code>ntp_gettime()</code> and <code>ntp_adjtime()</code>.</li>
<li>The clock keeps time with a precision of one microsecond. The nanokernel keeps time using even fractional nanoseconds. In real life operating systems there are clocks that are much worse.</li>
<li>Time can be corrected in quantities of one microsecond, or even fractional microseconds using the nanokernel, and repetitive corrections accumulate. The UNIX system call <code>adjtime()</code> does not accumulate successive corrections.</li>
<li>The clock model maintains additional parameters that can be queried or controlled. Among these are:
<ul>
<li>A <em>clock synchronization status</em> that shows the state of the clock machinery (<code>TIME_OK</code>).</li>
<li>Several <em>clock control and status bits</em> that control and show the state of the machinery (<code>STA_PLL</code>). This includes automatic handling of announced leap seconds.</li>
<li>Correction values for <em>clock offset</em> and <em>frequency</em> that are automatically applied.</li>
<li>Other control and monitoring values like <em>precision</em>, <em>estimated error</em>, and <em>frequency tolerance</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Corrections to the clock can be automatically maintained and applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applying corrections automatically within the operating system kernel no longer requires periodic corrections through an application program.</p>

<h4 id="5212-does-my-operating-system-have-the-kernel-discipline">5.2.1.2 Does my Operating System have the Kernel Discipline?</h4>
<p>If you can find an include file named <code>timex.h</code> that contains a structure named <code>timex</code> and constants like <code>STA_PLL</code> and <code>STA_UNSYNC</code>, you probably have the kernel discipline implemented. To make sure, try using the <code>ntp_gettime()</code> system call.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="5213-how-can-i-verify-the-kernel-discipline">5.2.1.3 How can I verify the Kernel Discipline?</h4>
<p>The following guidelines were presented by <a href="mailto:mills@udel.edu">Professor David L. Mills</a>:</p>
<p>Feedback loops and in particular phase-lock loops and I go way, way back since the first time I built one as part of a frequency synthesizer project as a grad student in 1959. All the theory I could dredge up then convinced me they were evil, non-linear things and tamed only by experiment, breadboard and cut-and-try. Not so now, of course, but the cut-and-try still lives on. The essential lessons I learned back then and have forgotten and relearned every ten years or so are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Carefully calibrate the frequency to the control voltage and never forget it.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t try to improve performance by cranking up the gain beyond the phase crossover.</li>
<li>Keep the loop delay much smaller than the time constant.</li>
<li>For the first couple of decade re-learns, the critters were analog and with short time constants so I could watch it with a scope. The last couple of re-learns were digital with time constants of days. So, another lesson:</li>
</ol>
<p>There is nothing in an analog loop that can&rsquo;t be done in a digital loop except debug it with a pair of headphones and a good test oscillator. Yes, I did say headphones.</p>
<p>So, this nonsense leads me to a couple of simple experiments:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, open the loop (<code>kill ntpd</code>). Using <code>ntptime</code>, zero the frequency and offset. Measure the frequency offset, which could take a day.</li>
<li>Then, do the same thing with a known offset via <code>ntptime</code> of say 50 PPM. You now have really and truly calibrated the VFO gain.</li>
<li>Next, close the loop after forcing the local clock maybe 100 ms offset. Watch the offset-time characteristic. Make sure it crosses zero in about 3000 s and overshoots about 5 percent. That with a time constant of 6 in the current nanokernel.</li>
</ol>
<p>In very simple words, step 1 means that you measure the error of your clock without any correction. You should see a linear increase for the offset. Step 2 says you should then try a correction with a fixed offset. Finally, step 3 applies corrections using varying frequency corrections.</p>

<h4 id="523-pps-processing">5.2.3 PPS Processing</h4>
<h4 id="5231-what-is-pps-processing">5.2.3.1 What is PPS Processing?</h4>
<p>During normal time synchronization, the server time stamps are compared about every 20 minutes to compute the required corrections for frequency and offset. With PPS processing, a similar thing is done every second. Therefore it&rsquo;s just time synchronization on a smaller scale. The idea is to keep the system clock tightly coupled with the external reference clock providing the PPS signal.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="5232-how-is-pps-processing-related-to-the-kernel-discipline">5.2.3.2 How is PPS Processing related to the Kernel Discipline?</h4>
<p>PPS processing can be done in application programs, but it makes much more sense when done in the operating system kernel. When polling a time source every 20 minutes, an offset of 5ms is rather small, but when polling a signal every second, an offset of 5ms is very high. Therefore a high accuracy is required for PPS processing. Application programs usually can&rsquo;t fulfil these demands.</p>
<p>The kernel clock model includes algorithms to discipline the clock through an external pulse, the PPS. The additional requirements consist of two mechanisms: capturing an external event with high accuracy, and applying that event to the clock model. The first is solved using the <a href="/ntpfaq/ntp-s-config-adv/#62451-what-is-that-pps-api">PPS API</a>, while the second is implemented mostly in a routine named <code>hardpps()</code> which is called every time when an external PPS event has been detected.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="5233-what-does-hardpps-do">5.2.3.3 What does hardpps() do?</h4>
<p><code>hardpps()</code> is called with two parameters, the absolute time of the event, and the time relative to the last pulse. Both times are measured by the system clock.</p>
<p>The first value is used to minimize the difference between the system clock&rsquo;s start of a second and the external event, while the second value is used to minimize the difference in clock frequency. Normally <code>hardpps()</code> just monitors (<code>STA_PPSSIGNAL</code>, PPS frequency, stability and jitter) the external events, but does not apply corrections to the system clock.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 5.2a: PPS Synchronization</strong></p>
<p><p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="/ntpfaq/hardpps.png" alt=""  />
</p></p>
<p><code>hardpps()</code> can minimize the differences of both frequency and offset between the system clock and an external reference.</p>
<p>Flag <code>STA_PPSFREQ</code> enables periodic updates to the clock&rsquo;s frequency correction. Stable clocks require only small and infrequent updates while bad clocks require frequent and large updates. The value passed as parameter is reduced to be a small value around zero, and then it is added to an accumulated value. After a specific amount of values has been added (at the end of a calibration interval), the total amount is divided by the length of the calibration interval, giving a new frequency correction.</p>
<p>When flag <code>STA_PPSTIME</code> is set, the start of a second is moved towards the PPS event, reducing the needed offset correction. The time offset given as argument to the routine will be put into a three-stage median filter to reduce spikes and to compute the jitter. Then an averaged value is applied as offset correction.</p>
<p>In addition to these direct manipulations, <code>hardpps()</code> also detects, signals, and filters various error conditions. The length of the calibration interval is also adjusted automatically. As the limit for a bad calibration is ridiculously high (about 500 PPM per calibration), the calibration interval normally is always at its configured maximum.</p>

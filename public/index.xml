      <title>A Kernel Model for Precision Timekeeping</title>
      <link>https://doc.ntp.org/archives/3-5.93e/kern/</link>

      <guid>https://doc.ntp.org/archives/3-5.93e/kern/</guid>
      <description>The technical memorandum: A Kernel Model for Precision Timekeeping (PDF) describes an engineering model which implements a precision time-of-day function for a generic operating system. The model is based on the principles of disciplined oscillators using phase-lock loops (PLL) and frequency-lock loops (FLL) often found in the engineering literature. The model implements a hybrid PLL/FLL discipline algorithm implemented in the kernel. The hybrid loop provides automatic time and frequency steering with update intervals from a few seconds to several hours.</description>

      <description>The technical memorandum: A Kernel Programming Interface for Precision Time Signals (PDF) describes a proposed programming interface for external precision time signals, such as the pulse-per-second (PPS) signal generated by some radio clocks and cesium oscillators.
The memorandum argues for a generic capability in the ubiquitous Unix kernel, which could be used for a wide variety of measurement applications, including network time synchronization and experiments involving performance measurement and evaluation of computer networks and transmission systems.</description>

      <description>Problem with recent ANSI compilers On some systems, including AIX, the compiler quits on the ntp_refclock.c file when processing the refclock_report() routine. The problem, which is eithre a feature or a bug, has to do with an unwanted promotion of the u_char argument to an int and a failure of the compiler to recognize the preceding prototype. A workaround is to use ANSI syntax to delare the arguments. Since ANSI compilers are not universally available, this syntax can&#39;t be used in the stock distribution.</description>

      <description>A Hollerith Card
In 1896 Herman Hollerith organized the Tabulating Machines Company, which grew in subsequent mergers to become the IBM of today. The Hollerith punched card was the principal means for recording, accounting and archiving functions, not to mention the US census, until recently. In the early 1960&amp;rsquo;s Hollerith cards were the only practical means to input programs for a IBM mainframe, but today these cards are seldom seen.</description>

      <description>Author:	Bdale Garbee, bdale@gag.com Last revision:	27Oct94 (Paul Vixie) Included in this distribution of XNTP is a configuration file suitable for use with BSDI&#39;s BSD/OS 1.1 (formerly BSD/386 1.1). On this system, the &#34;cc&#34; command is GCC 1.4x rather than PCC or GCC 2.x. It is imperative that &#34;cc&#34; be used since it predefines the symbol __bsdi__; if you want to use another compiler you will need to add -D__bsdi__ to catch the various #ifdef&#39;s required for this system.</description>

 Most modern software distributions include an autoconfigure utility which customizes the build and install configuration according to the specific hardware, operating system and file system conventions. For NTP this utility is called configure, which is run before building and installing the program components. For most installations no additional actions are required other than running configure with no options.</description>

      <description>Last update: 15-Nov-2012 06:02 UTC
 The clock cluster algorithm processes the truechimers produced by the clock select algorithm to produce a list of survivors. These survivors are used by the mitigation algorithms to discipline the system clock. The cluster algorithm operates in a series of rounds, where at each round the truechimer furthest from the offset centroid is pruned from the population. The rounds are continued until a specified termination condition is met.</description>

 Table of Contents  General Overview Clock Discipline Operations Loop Dynamics Clock Initialization and Management   General Overview At the heart of the NTP specification and reference implementation is the clock discipline algorithm, which is best described as an adaptive parameter, hybrid phase/frequency-lock feedback loop. It is an intricately crafted algorithm that automatically adapts for optimum performance while minimizing network overhead. Operation is in two modes, phase-lock loop (PLL), which is used at poll intervals below the Allan intercept, by default 2048 s, and frequency-lock loop (FLL), which is used above that.</description>

 The clock filter algorithm processes the offset and delay samples produced by the on-wire protocol for each peer process separately. It uses a sliding window of eight samples and picks out the sample with the least expected error. This page describes the algorithm design principles along with an example of typical performance.

      <description>Last update: 10-Mar-2014 05:22 UTC
 The clock select algorithm determines from a set of sources , which are correct (truechimers) and which are not (falsetickers) according to a set of formal correctness assertions. The principles are based on the observation that the maximum error in determining the offset of a candidate cannot exceed one-half the roundtrip delay to the primary reference clock at the time of measurement. This must be increased by the maximum error that can accumulate since then.</description>

      <description>FAX test image for SATNET (1979).
The baby panda was scanned at University College London and used as a FAX test image for a demonstration of the DARPA Atlantic SATNET Program and the first transatlantic Internet connection in 1979. The computing system used for that demonstration was called the Fuzzball. As it happened, this was also the first Internet multimedia presentation and the first to use NTP in regular operation. The image was widely copied and used for testing throughout much of the 1980s.</description>

      <description>Basic Configuration Options - the configure utility The following options are for compiling and installing a working version of the xntp3 distribution. In most cases, the build process is completely automatic. In some cases where memory space is at a premium, or the binaries are to be installed in a different place, it is possible to tailor the configuration to remove such features as reference clock driver support, debugging support, and so forth.</description>

      <description>I was chief nerd for several projects in the fifteen years I was with U Michigan, first in electrical engineering and then in computer science. This is one of them.
In the late 60s IBM was the crushing giant, while Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) was yet a pipsqueak. The U Michigan Computing Center had a giant - a two-processor System 360 Model 67 processor with a dazzling one megabyte of core memory.</description>

      <description>The ntpq and xntpdc utility programs can be used to debug reference clocks, either on the server itself or from another machine elsewhere in the network. The server is compiled, installed and started using the configuration file described in the xntpd page. The first thing to look for are error messages on the system log. If none occur, the daemon has started, opened the devices specified and waiting for peers and radios to come up.</description>

      <description>Some major changes were necessary to make xntp v3 run on the DEC Alpha hardware running DEC OSF/1. All &#34;long&#34; and &#34;u_long&#34; declarations and casts in the code were changed to &#34;LONG&#34; and &#34;U_LONG&#34; and a new header file (include/ntp_types.h) was added. The new header file defines LONG as int and U_LONG as u_int for the Alpha hardware and as long and u_long for anything else. A couple of #ifs where changed in ntpq and xntpdc to get the result of a signal defined correctly.</description>

Reference ID: DUMBCLOCK
Driver ID: DUMBCLOCK
Serial Port: /dev/dumbclock_u_; 9600 bps, 8-bits, no parity
Features: (none)
 Description This driver supports a dumb ASCII clock that only emits localtime at a reliable interval. This has no provisions for leap seconds, quality codes, etc. It assumes output in the local time zone, and that the C library mktime()/localtime() routines will correctly convert back and forth between local and UTC.</description>

      <description>The NTPv4 implementation includes provisions for an external clock, where the system clock is implemented by some external hardware device. One implementation might take the form of a bus peripheral with a high resolution counter disciplined by a GPS receiver, for example. Another implementation might involve another synchronization protocol, such as the Digital Time Synchronization Service (DTSS), where the system time is disciplined to this protocol and NTP clients of the server obtain synchronization indirectly via the server.</description>

 The NTPv4 implementation includes provisions for an external clock, where the system clock is implemented by some external hardware device. One implementation might take the form of a bus peripheral with a high resolution counter disciplined by a GPS receiver, for example. Another implementation might involve another synchronization protocol, such as the Digital Time Synchronization Service (DTSS), where the system time is disciplined to this protocol and NTP clients of the server obtain synchronization indirectly via the server.</description>

 Description This driver supports the Forum Graphic GPS Dating station sold by EMR company.
Unfortunately, sometimes FG GPS start continues reporting of the same date. The only way to fix this problem is GPS power cycling and ntpd restart after GPS power-up.
After Jan 10, 2000 my FG GPS unit start send a wrong answer after 10:00am till 11:00am.</description>

      <description>If you are compiling under FreeBSD and see messages in the syslogs that indicate that the ntpd process is trying to use unavailable sched_ calls, it means you are running a kernel that does not have the POSIX scheduling calls enabled. You have two choices: - Ignore the messages - Generate a new kernel, where the kernel configuration file contains the lines: options	&#34;P1003_1B&#34; options	&#34;_KPOSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING&#34; options	&#34;_KPOSIX_VERSION=199309L&#34;  </description>

      <description>Table of Contents  Conformance Statement Selected Bibliography   Conformance Statement The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time of a computer client or server to another server or reference time source, such as a radio or satellite receiver or modem. It provides accuracies typically within a millisecond on LANs up to a few tens of milliseconds on WANs relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), as provided by a Global Positioning Service (GPS) receiver, for example.</description>

 Historical Notes on NTP Upgrades This is an interim report on recent upgrades to the NTPv4 reference implementation code base and documentation. This report documents the upgrade program, which began in June 2007 and continued until March 2008. It is very important to recognize that this historic document describes the upgrade status as of 2008. Additional upgrades have been implemented since then. As of mid 2011, the additional upgrades are documented on the NTP Version 4 Release Notes page.</description>

First off, all the standard disclaimers hold here ... HP doesn&#39;t have anthing to do with this stuff. I fool with it in my spare time because we use it and because I like to. We just happen to have a lot of HP machines around here :-) Xntpd has been in use here for several years and has a fair amount of mileage on various HP platforms within the company.</description>

Exploding kernel
 The technical report 2, which is a major revision and update of an earlier report 3, describes an engineering model for a precision time-of-day function for a generic operating system. The model is based on the principles of disciplined oscillators using phase-lock loops (PLL) and frequency-lock loops (FLL) often found in the engineering literature. The model uses a hybrid PLL/FLL discipline algorithm implemented in the kernel.</description>

      <description>The technical report 1 describes a proposed application programming interface (API) for external precision time signals, such as the pulse-per-second (PPS) signal generated by some radio clocks and cesium oscillators. The report argues for a generic capability in the ubiquitous Unix kernel, which could be used for a wide variety of measurement applications, including network time synchronization and experiments involving performance measurement and evaluation of computer networks and transmission systems. The hardware to do this requires only a serial port and a modem control lead, such as the data carrier detect (DCD) lead, which can be driven by an external source via a level converter/pulse generator.</description>

 About every eighteen months the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS) issues a bulletin announcing the insertion of a leap second in the Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) timescale. Ordinarily, this happens at the end of the last day of June or December; but, in principle, it could happen at the end of any month. While these bulletins are available on the Internet at www.iers.org, advance notice of leap seconds is also available in signals broadcast from national time and frequency stations, in GPS signals and in telephone modem services.</description>

The Michigan Terminal System (MTS), along with Multics at MIT, were the first operational virtual memory operating systems in the world. The pictures here, taken circa 1969, give some idea of the computing systems of that era.</description>

 Commands and Options  broadcastdelay delay  In broadcast and multicast modes, means are required to determine the network delay between the server and client. Ordinarily, this is done automatically by the initial calibration exchanges between the client and server. In some cases, the exchange might not be possible due to network or server access controls.</description>

      <description>HP e3000 MPE/iX NTP Hints - May 29, 2001 ---------------------------------------- NTP was first ported to MPE several years ago, but those diffs were never submitted back to the official NTP distribution. For more information about that deprecated port, please see http://www.bixby.org/mark/xntpix.html. NTP was re-ported to MPE in May 2001. What follows are hints learned from working with NTP 4.0.99k23. For additional information about NTP on MPE, please see http://jazz.external.hp.com/src/hp_freeware/ntp/. MPE lacks the clock-related APIs expected by NTP, so adjtime(), gettimeofday(), and settimeofday() all had to be implemented from scratch by calling privileged, undocumented internal OS functions.</description>

      <description>Notes for NTP Version 3 This version operates in much the same manner as Version 2 with the following changes and additions: 1. The protocol machinery operates in conformance with the RFC1305 NTP Version 3 specification. The most visible characteristic of this version is that the poll intervals for all polls, even selected ones, is significantly increased. This is especially desirable when serving a large client population. This implementation supports previous versions as non-configured peers; for version-2 configured peers a &#34;</description>

Usually, the command line that starts the daemon is included in the system startup file, so it is executed only at system boot time; however, the daemon can be stopped and restarted from root at any time.

 In the protocol described in the NTP specification and implemented today the transmit timestamp is captured before the MD5 digest is computed and the packet is sent, while the receive timestamp is captured after the packet is received. For enhanced accuracy it is desirable to capture the timestamps as close to the wire as possible; i.</description>

 In the protocol described in the NTP specification and reference implementation up to now, the transmit timestamp, which is captured before the message digest is computed and the packet queued for output, is properly called as a softstamp. The receive timestamp, which is captured after the input driver interrupt routine and before the packet is queued for input, is properly called a drivestamp.</description>

 Sometimes an NTP subnet becomes isolated from all UTC sources such as local reference clocks or Internet time servers. In such cases it may be necessary that the subnet servers and clients remain synchronized to a common timescale, not necessarily the UTC timescale. Previously, this function was provided by the local clock driver to simulate a UTC source. A server with this driver could be used to synchronize other hosts in the subnet directly or indirectly.</description>

      <description>Last update: 10-Mar-2014 05:17 UTC
 The poll process sends NTP packets at intervals determined by the clock discipline algorithm. The process is designed to provide a sufficient update rate to maximize accuracy while minimizing network overhead. The process is designed to operate over a poll exponent range between 3 (8 s) and 17 (36 hr). The minimum and maximum poll exponent within this range can be set using the minpoll and maxpoll options of the server command, with default 6 (64 s) and 10 (1024 s), respectively.</description>

Say it three times and it must be right.
 The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time of a computer client or server to another server or reference time source, such as a radio or satellite receiver or modem. It provides accuracies typically within a millisecond on LANs up to a few tens of milliseconds on WANs relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), as provided by a Global Positioning Service (GPS) receiver, for example.</description>

      <description>Some radio clocks and related timekeeping gear have a pulse-per-second (PPS) signal that can be used to discipline the local clock oscillator to a high degree of precision, typically to the order less than 50 us in time and 0.1 PPM in frequency. The PPS signal can be connected in either of two ways: via the data leads of a serial port or via the modem control leads. Either way requires conversion of the PPS signal, usually at TTL levels, to RS232 levels, which can be done using a circuit such as described in the Gadget Box PPS Level Converter and CHU Modem page.</description>

      <description>FAX test image for SATNET (1979).
The baby panda was scanned at University College London and used as a FAX test image for a demonstration of the DARPA Atlantic SATNET Program and the first transatlantic Internet connection in 1978. The computing system used for that demonstration was called the Fuzzball. As it happened, this was also the first Internet multimedia presentation and the first to use a predecessor of NTP in regular operation.</description>

      <description>The following changes are in the version 3-5.85 distribution relative to the previous 3.5f version.
  The automatic build procedure has been replaced with GNU autoconfigure. This should make porting to nonstandard machines and operating systems much easier and should simplify the maintenance for multi-architecture sites. See the ./WHERE-TO- START/, ./INSTALL and ./README files for a brief overview of the new building and installing procedures. See the building and installing pages in the HTML documentation for further information.</description>

      <description>15.7.1993 xntp3 compiles now again on AIX. I have disabled prototyping and added the switch -D_NO_PROTO which disables prototyping in the system include files. Matthias Ernst maer@nmr.lpc.ethz.ch -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Xntp version 3 now support the cc compiler for AIX. The Config.aix will now use cc by default. You can still compile xntp with the bsd compiler by changing &#34;COMP= cc&#34; to &#34;COMP= bsdcc&#34; and removing the &#34;-DSTUPID_SIGNAL&#34; option from the &#34;DEFS&#34; option.</description>

 Older SCO Unix versions NTP 4.0.x does not run on SCO Unix prior to version 3.2.5.0.0. If you need NTP on an older SCO Unix system and don&amp;rsquo;t mind to modify your kernel, use 3.5.91 which has patches for SCO Unix 3.2.4.x.
 Compiling NTP Delete the old SCO supplied NTP programs using the &amp;ldquo;custom&amp;rdquo; utility. Run the NTP configure program with CFLAGS=&amp;quot;-b elf -K _processor-type_&amp;quot; for best results.</description>

      <description>adjtime, tick and tickadj: -------------------------- The SGI value for HZ is 100 under Irix 4, with the system clock running in nominal mode (ftimer off), so the value for tick is 10000 usec. Tickadj is a bit more tricky because of the behaviour of adjtime(), which seems to try to perform the correction over 100-200 seconds, with a rate limit of 0.04 secs/sec for large corrections. Corrections of less than 0.</description>

      <description>Bug Id: 4023118 Category: kernel Subcategory: other State: integrated Synopsis: sun4u doesn&#39;t keep accurate time Description: [ bmc, 12/20/96 ] The clock on a sun4u drifts unacceptably. On a typical 143 mHz Ultra, the clock took 1.0001350 seconds to count 1 second. While this may seem trivial, it adds up quickly. In this case, the TOD chip will have to pull the clock forward by 2 seconds every 4 hours and 7 minutes.</description>

The only place it is set is in the ntp_adjtime system call, from the &#39;constant&#39; element of the timex structure argument.</description>

There are some new files as well: xntp	shell script that starts up ntp during boot up (the packaging stuff creates links to it so it comes up at run level 2).

      <description>Notes on CPU clock oscillator tolerance with SunOS 4.1.1 and 4.1.3 A bug in SunOS 4.1.1 results in the kernel time losing 1 microsecond per tick of the system clock. The bug was fixed (bugid 1094383) for SunOS 4.1.1 and corrected in SunOS 4.1.3. The easiest way to fix this is to replace the 4.1.1 binary clock.o with the corresponding 4.1.3 binary. Without this change it is necessary to use the tickadj program included in this distribution with the -t 9999 option.</description>

The Fuzzball The Fuzzball is an operating system and a package of applications for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP11 family of computers, including the LSI-11 board-level components. The package was conceived in 1971 as a replacement for the RAMP operating system for the DEC PDP8 3. It later was evolved as a virtual machine supporting the DEC RT-11 operating system and early developmental versions of the TCP/IP protocol and applications suite.</description>

      <description>Last update: 10-Mar-2014 05:09 UTC
 In scenarios where a considerable amount of data are downloaded or uploaded using DSL or telephone modem lines, timekeeping quality can be seriously degraded. This occurs because the traffic volume, and thus the queuing delays, on the upload and download directions of transmission can be very different. In many cases the apparent time errors are so large as to exceed the step threshold and a step correction can occur during and after the data transfer.</description>

The particular variables it is concerned with are tick, which is the number of microseconds added to the system time for a clock interrupt, tickadj, which sets the slew rate and resolution used by the adjtime system call, and dosynctodr, which indicates to the kernels on some machines whether they should internally adjust the system clock to keep it in line with time-of-day clock or not.</description>

      <title>vxWorks port</title>

Creating a port for vxWorks posed some problems. This port may help as a starting point for similar ports to real-time OS&amp;rsquo;s and other embeddable kernels, particularly where main() is not allowed, and where the configure scripts need to be altered.
 Configuration issues I decided to do as little invasive surgery as possible on the NTP code, so I brought the vxWorks header tree in line with the standard Unix tree.</description>

      <description>Introduction The NTP 4 distribution runs as service on Windows 2000 and later. It will NOT run on Windows 95, 98, ME, etc. Lately it has been run the most on Windows-7 and later. The binaries work on multi-processor systems. This port has not been tested on the Alpha platform. This release now uses OpenSSL for authentication. IPv6 is not implemented yet for Win32 platforms. A ready-to-run install distribution is available from Meinberg at http://www.</description>

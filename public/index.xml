Abstract This memo suggests protocol and security enhancements for the Network Time Protocol (NTP) described in RFC 5905, along with a replacement for the Autokey security scheme described in RFC 5906.
The primary goals in this memo are to improve synchronization accuracy in all protocol modes. Secondary goals include improved resistance to wiretap and middleman attacks that exploit weaknesses in the error detection and recovery procedures.</description>

      <guid>https://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-time/</guid>
      <description>This section discusses general topics related to time and time-keeping.
  2.1 What is Time? 2.2 What is UTC? 2.3 Is UTC the same as GMT? 2.4 What happens during a Leap Second?   2.1 What is Time? This quote from a fortune cookie from Edition 7: &amp;ldquo;Time has been invented in the universe so that everything would not happen at once.&amp;rdquo;
There&amp;rsquo;s another interesting relation between time and change: There is no change without the concept of time, and there is no movement without time.</description>

      <title>3. How do Computer Clocks work?</title>

      <guid>https://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-sw-clocks/</guid>
      <description>This section tries to explain the basics of software clocks used in computers. In principle, such clocks just consist of an oscillator and a counter.
 3.1 Bits and Registers Computers are good at adding bits. Therefore time is stored in a number of bits, and adding to these bits makes the time go on. The meaning of the value &amp;ldquo;zero&amp;rdquo; has to be defined separately (usually this is called the epoch).</description>

      <title>3.2 Making Time go on</title>
      <link>https://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-sw-clocks-tick/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-sw-clocks-tick/</guid>
      <description>The number of bits together with a definition of resolution and epoch are used to store time stamps. For a real clock, time must advance automatically.
A defined resolution of nanoseconds is useless if the value is updated once per minute. If you are still not convinced, consider reading such a clock three times a minute, and compare the time you would get.
So we want a frequent update of the time bits.</description>

      <description>3.3.1 Frequency Error
3.3.1.1 How bad is a Frequency Error of 500 PPM?
3.3.1.2 What is the Frequency Error of a good Clock?
 When discussing clocks, the following quality factors are helpful:
  The smallest possible increase of time the clock model allows is called resolution. If a clock increments its value once per second, the resolution is one second.
  A high resolution does not help if you can&amp;rsquo;t read the clock.</description>

      <guid>https://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-def-hist/</guid>
      <description>This section summarizes the history of NTP in a few words. Most material has been taken from a draft of A Brief History of NTP Time: Confessions of an Internet Timekeeper by Professor David L. Mills.
 The first NTP implementation started around 1980 with an accuracy of only several hundred milliseconds. That very first implementation was documented in Internet Engineering Note IEN-173. Later the first specification appeared in RFC 778, but it was still named Internet Clock Service.</description>

      <guid>https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8p16-release-announcement/</guid>
      <description>The NTP Project at Network Time Foundation publicly released ntp-4.2.8p16 on Tuesday, 30 May 2023.
This release fixes two security issues in ntpd:
  Low: Sec 3807: praecis_parse() in ntpd/refclock_palisade.c can write out-of-bounds
The Praecis reference clock gets time information from 3G CDMA cellphone towers, and relays it to ntpd over a serial port. Support for the Praecis refclock was added in November of 2002, before &amp;ldquo;defensive programming&amp;rdquo; was the norm.</description>

      <description>This section will try to explain how NTP will construct and maintain a working time synchronization network.
5.1 Basic Concepts To help understand the details of planning, configuring, and maintaining NTP, some basic concepts are presented here. The focus in this section is on theory.
5.1.1 Time References
5.1.1.1 What is a reference clock?

      <description>In addition to the NTP protocol specification, there exists a description for a kernel clock model (RFC 1589) that is discussed here.
5.2.1 Basic Functionality
5.2.1.1 What is special about the Kernel Clock?
5.2.1.2 Does my Operating System have the Kernel Discipline?
5.2.1.3 How can I verify the Kernel Discipline? 5.2.2 Monitoring

5.3.2 Why should I have more than one clock?
5.3.3 Does the reference time depend on all configured servers, or is it based on which ever responds first?
5.3.4 What happens during a Leap Second?
 5.3.1 What if I write my own SNTP Server? There is a quote (with partial omissions) on that subject by Professor David L.</description>

      <description>This section discusses the use of encryption and related technology for NTP.
Providing or enabling the use of encryption in software was considered harmful by the USA. However electronic commerce is only possibly with safe data exchange, so use of encryption has become a bit more allowed. NTP version 4 includes no cryptography, from the viewpoint of government regulations, and introduces MD5 keys.
As MD5 is heavily used in digital signatures, MD5 is not considered as cryptography, despite the fact that digital signatures actually do use encryption.</description>

6.2.1 Server Selection
6.2.1.1 What is the rule of thumb for number of servers to synchronize to?
6.2.1.2 Should the servers be a mix of primary and secondary servers?

6.3.2 Avoiding Time Steps 6.3.3 Using the Echo Feature in PPS API
 6.3.1 Mixing Time Protocols  Note: Mixing different time protocols is generally deprecated, because it can invalidate some assumptions necessary for proper operation of any time protocol.
 However, sometimes there is a need for NTP to utilize a server that is using a different Time protocol. The short and possibly unpleasant answer is: &amp;ldquo;Run NTP on that server!</description>

      <description>The technical memorandum: A Kernel Model for Precision Timekeeping (PDF) describes an engineering model which implements a precision time-of-day function for a generic operating system. The model is based on the principles of disciplined oscillators using phase-lock loops (PLL) and frequency-lock loops (FLL) often found in the engineering literature. The model implements a hybrid PLL/FLL discipline algorithm implemented in the kernel. The hybrid loop provides automatic time and frequency steering with update intervals from a few seconds to several hours.</description>

      <description>The technical memorandum: A Kernel Programming Interface for Precision Time Signals (PDF) describes a proposed programming interface for external precision time signals, such as the pulse-per-second (PPS) signal generated by some radio clocks and cesium oscillators.
The memorandum argues for a generic capability in the ubiquitous Unix kernel, which could be used for a wide variety of measurement applications, including network time synchronization and experiments involving performance measurement and evaluation of computer networks and transmission systems.</description>

      <description>Problem with recent ANSI compilers On some systems, including AIX, the compiler quits on the ntp_refclock.c file when processing the refclock_report() routine. The problem, which is either a feature or a bug, has to do with an unwanted promotion of the u_char argument to an int and a failure of the compiler to recognize the preceding prototype. A workaround is to use ANSI syntax to delare the arguments. Since ANSI compilers are not universally available, this syntax can&amp;rsquo;t be used in the stock distribution.</description>

      <description>A Hollerith Card
In 1896 Herman Hollerith organized the Tabulating Machines Company, which grew in subsequent mergers to become the IBM of today. The Hollerith punched card was the principle means for recording, accounting and archiving functions, not to mention the US census, until recently. In the early 1960&amp;rsquo;s Hollerith cards were the only practical means to input programs for a IBM mainframe, but today these cards are seldom seen.</description>

On this system, the cc command is GCC 1.4x rather than PCC or GCC 2.x. It is imperative that cc be used since it predefines the symbol _bsdi_; if you want to use another compiler you will need to add -D_bsdi_ to catch the various #ifdef&amp;rsquo;s required for this system.</description>

Gnu autoconfigure tools are in the backpack.
 Most modern software distributions include an autoconfigure utility which customizes the build and install configuration according to the specific hardware, operating system and file system conventions. For NTP this utility is called configure, which is run before building and installing the program components. For most installations no additional actions are required other than running configure with no options.</description>

      <description>The clock cluster algorithm processes the truechimers produced by the clock select algorithm to produce a list of survivors. These survivors are used by the mitigation algorithms to discipline the system clock. The cluster algorithm operates in a series of rounds, where at each round the truechimer furthest from the offset centroid is pruned from the population. The rounds are continued until a specified termination condition is met. This page discusses the algorithm in detail.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents  General Overview Clock Discipline Operations Loop Dynamics Clock Initialization and Management   General Overview At the heart of the NTP specification and reference implementation is the clock discipline algorithm, which is best described as an adaptive parameter, hybrid phase/frequency-lock feedback loop. It is an intricately crafted algorithm that automatically adapts for optimum performance while minimizing network overhead. Operation is in two modes, phase-lock loop (PLL), which is used at poll intervals below the Allan intercept, by default 2048 s, and frequency-lock loop (FLL), which is used above that.</description>

      <description>The clock filter algorithm processes the offset and delay samples produced by the on-wire protocol for each peer process separately. It uses a sliding window of eight samples and picks out the sample with the least expected error. This page describes the algorithm design principles along with an example of typical performance.

      <description>The clock select algorithm determines from a set of sources , which are correct (truechimers) and which are not (falsetickers) according to a set of formal correctness assertions. The principles are based on the observation that the maximum error in determining the offset of a candidate cannot exceed one-half the roundtrip delay to the primary reference clock at the time of measurement. This must be increased by the maximum error that can accumulate since then.</description>

The computing system used for that demonstration was called the Fuzzball. As it happened, this was also the first Internet multimedia presentation and the first to use NTP in regular operation.</description>

      <description>Basic Configuration Options - the configure utility The following options are for compiling and installing a working version of the xntp3 distribution. In most cases, the build process is completely automatic. In some cases where memory space is at a premium, or the binaries are to be installed in a different place, it is possible to tailor the configuration to remove such features as reference clock driver support, debugging support, and so forth.</description>

      <description>I was chief nerd for several projects in the fifteen years I was with U Michigan, first in electrical engineering and then in computer science. This is one of them.
In the late 60s IBM was the crushing giant, while Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) was yet a pipsqueak. The U Michigan Computing Center had a giant - a two-processor System 360 Model 67 processor with a dazzling one megabyte of core memory.</description>

      <description>The ntpq and xntpdc utility programs can be used to debug reference clocks, either on the server itself or from another machine elsewhere in the network. The server is compiled, installed and started using the configuration file described in the xntpd page. The first thing to look for are error messages on the system log. If none occur, the daemon has started, opened the devices specified and waiting for peers and radios to come up.</description>

      <description>Some major changes were necessary to make xntp v3 run on the DEC Alpha hardware running DEC OSF/1. All long and u_long declarations and casts in the code were changed to LONG and U_LONG and a new header file (include/ntp_types.h) was added. The new header file defines LONG as int and U_LONG as u_int for the Alpha hardware and as long and u_long for anything else. A couple of #ifs where changed in ntpq and xntpdc to get the result of a signal defined correctly.</description>

Reference ID: DUMBCLOCK
Driver ID: DUMBCLOCK
Serial Port: /dev/dumbclocku; 9600 bps, 8-bits, no parity
Features: none
 Description This driver supports a dumb ASCII clock that only emits localtime at a reliable interval. This has no provisions for leap seconds, quality codes, etc. It assumes output in the local time zone, and that the C library mktime() / localtime() routines will correctly convert back and forth between local and UTC.</description>

      <description>The NTPv4 implementation includes provisions for an external clock, where the system clock is implemented by some external hardware device. One implementation might take the form of a bus peripheral with a high resolution counter disciplined by a GPS receiver, for example. Another implementation might involve another synchronization protocol, such as the Digital Time Synchronization Service (DTSS), where the system time is disciplined to this protocol and NTP clients of the server obtain synchronization indirectly via the server.</description>

      <description>The NTPv4 implementation includes provisions for an external clock, where the system clock is implemented by some external hardware device. One implementation might take the form of a bus peripheral with a high resolution counter disciplined by a GPS receiver, for example. Another implementation might involve another synchronization protocol, such as the Digital Time Synchronization Service (DTSS), where the system time is disciplined to this protocol and NTP clients of the server obtain synchronization indirectly via the server.</description>

Driver ID: GPS
Parallel Port: /dev/fgclocku
 Description This driver supports the Forum Graphic GPS Dating station sold by EMR company.
Unfortunately, sometimes FG GPS start continues reporting of the same date. The only way to fix this problem is GPS power cycling and ntpd restart after GPS power-up.
After Jan 10, 2000 my FG GPS unit started sending a wrong answer after 10:00am till 11:00am.</description>

      <description>If you are compiling under FreeBSD and see messages in the syslogs that indicate that the ntpd process is trying to use unavailable sched_ calls, it means you are running a kernel that does not have the POSIX scheduling calls enabled.
 You have two choices:  Ignore the messages.     Generate a new kernel, where the kernel configuration file contains the lines:
options	&amp;quot;P1003_1B&amp;quot;options	&amp;quot;_KPOSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING&amp;quot;options	&amp;quot;_KPOSIX_VERSION=199309L&amp;quot;     </description>

      <description>Table of Contents  Conformance Statement Selected Bibliography   Conformance Statement The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time of a computer client or server to another server or reference time source, such as a radio or satellite receiver or modem. It provides accuracies typically within a millisecond on LANs up to a few tens of milliseconds on WANs relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), as provided by a Global Positioning Service (GPS) receiver, for example.</description>

      <description>May 29, 2001
 NTP was first ported to MPE several years ago, but those diffs were never submitted back to the official NTP distribution.
NTP was re-ported to MPE in May 2001. What follows are hints learned from working with NTP 4.0.99k23.
 MPE lacks the clock-related APIs expected by NTP, so adjtime(), gettimeofday(), and settimeofday() all had to be implemented from scratch by calling privileged, undocumented internal OS functions.</description>

      <description>This file hopefully describes the whatever and however of how to get xntp running on HP-UX 7.0 and later: s300, s400, s700, and s800.
First off, all the standard disclaimers hold here &amp;hellip; HP doesn&amp;rsquo;t have anything to do with this stuff. I fool with it in my spare time because we use it and because I like to. We just happen to have a lot of HP machines around here :-) xntpd has been in use here for several years and has a fair amount of mileage on various HP platforms within the company.</description>

 The technical report 2, which is a major revision and update of an earlier report 3, describes an engineering model for a precision time-of-day function for a generic operating system. The model is based on the principles of disciplined oscillators using phase-lock loops (PLL) and frequency-lock loops (FLL) often found in the engineering literature. The model uses a hybrid PLL/FLL discipline algorithm implemented in the kernel.</description>

The model uses a hybrid PLL/FLL discipline algorithm implemented in the kernel.</description>

      <description>The technical report 1 describes a proposed application programming interface (API) for external precision time signals, such as the pulse-per-second (PPS) signal generated by some radio clocks and cesium oscillators. The report argues for a generic capability in the ubiquitous Unix kernel, which could be used for a wide variety of measurement applications, including network time synchronization and experiments involving performance measurement and evaluation of computer networks and transmission systems. The hardware to do this requires only a serial port and a modem control lead, such as the data carrier detect (DCD) lead, which can be driven by an external source via a level converter/pulse generator.</description>

      <description>About every eighteen months the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS) issues a bulletin announcing the insertion of a leap second in the Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) timescale. Ordinarily, this happens at the end of the last day of June or December; but, in principle, it could happen at the end of any month. While these bulletins are available on the Internet at IERS, advance notice of leap seconds is also available in signals broadcast from national time and frequency stations, in GPS signals and in telephone modem services.</description>

The Michigan Terminal System (MTS), along with Multics at MIT, were the first operational virtual memory operating systems in the world. The pictures here, taken circa 1969, give some idea of the computing systems of that era.</description>

  broadcastdelay seconds  The broadcast and multicast modes require a special calibration to determine the network delay between the local and remote servers. Ordinarily, this is done automatically by the initial protocol exchanges between the client and server. In some cases, the calibration procedure may fail due to network or server access controls, for example. This command specifies the default delay to be used under these circumstances.</description>

      <description>This version operates in much the same manner as Version 2 with the following changes and additions:
  The protocol machinery operates in conformance with the RFC 1305 NTP Version 3 specification. The most visible characteristic of this version is that the poll intervals for all polls, even selected ones, is significantly increased. This is especially desirable when serving a large client population. This implementation supports previous versions as non-configured peers; for version-2 configured peers a version 2 keyword should be included on the peer line.</description>

      <description>This document describes the configuration file for the NTP Project’s ntpd program. This software is released under the NTP license.
Description The behavior of ntpd can be changed by a configuration file, by default ntp.conf.
 Notes The ntp.conf configuration file is read at initial startup by the ntpd daemon in order to specify the synchronization sources, modes and other related information. Usually, it is installed in the /etc directory, but could be installed elsewhere (see the daemon’s -c command line option).</description>

      <description>Once the NTP software distribution has been compiled and installed and the configuration file constructed, the next step is to verify correct operation and fix any bugs that may result. Usually, the command line that starts the daemon is included in the system startup file, so it is executed only at system boot time; however, the daemon can be stopped and restarted from root at any time. Usually, no command-line arguments are required, unless special actions described in the xntpd.</description>

      <description>from Pogo, Walt Kelly
You need a little magic.
 In the protocol described in the NTP specification and implemented today the transmit timestamp is captured before the MD5 digest is computed and the packet is sent, while the receive timestamp is captured after the packet is received. For enhanced accuracy it is desirable to capture the timestamps as close to the wire as possible; i.e., with hardware assist or with a modified driver.</description>

      <description>from Pogo, Walt Kelly
You need a little magic.
 In the protocol described in the NTP specification and reference implementation up to now, the transmit timestamp, which is captured before the message digest is computed and the packet queued for output, is properly called as a softstamp. The receive timestamp, which is captured after the input driver interrupt routine and before the packet is queued for input, is properly called a drivestamp.</description>

      <description>Sometimes an NTP subnet becomes isolated from all UTC sources such as local reference clocks or Internet time servers. In such cases it may be necessary that the subnet servers and clients remain synchronized to a common timescale, not necessarily the UTC timescale. Previously, this function was provided by the local clock driver to simulate a UTC source. A server with this driver could be used to synchronize other hosts in the subnet directly or indirectly.</description>

For recreational reading, I enjoy the study of ancient civilizations; in particular, their writing and calendar systems.

      <description>The poll process sends NTP packets at intervals determined by the clock discipline algorithm. The process is designed to provide a sufficient update rate to maximize accuracy while minimizing network overhead. The process is designed to operate over a poll exponent range between 3 (8 s) and 17 (36 hr). The minimum and maximum poll exponent within this range can be set using the minpoll and maxpoll options of the server command, with default 6 (64 s) and 10 (1024 s), respectively.</description>

Say it three times and it must be right.
 The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time of a computer client or server to another server or reference time source, such as a radio or satellite receiver or modem. It provides accuracies typically within a millisecond on LANs up to a few tens of milliseconds on WANs relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), as provided by a Global Positioning Service (GPS) receiver, for example.</description>

      <description>Some radio clocks and related timekeeping gear have a pulse-per-second (PPS) signal that can be used to discipline the local clock oscillator to a high degree of precision, typically to the order less than 50 us in time and 0.1 PPM in frequency. The PPS signal can be connected in either of two ways: via the data leads of a serial port or via the modem control leads. Either way requires conversion of the PPS signal, usually at TTL levels, to RS232 levels, which can be done using a circuit such as described in the Gadget Box PPS Level Converter and CHU Modem page.</description>

      <description>FAX test image for SATNET (1979).
The baby panda was scanned at University College London and used as a FAX test image for a demonstration of the DARPA Atlantic SATNET Program and the first transatlantic Internet connection in 1978. The computing system used for that demonstration was called the Fuzzball. As it happened, this was also the first Internet multimedia presentation and the first to use a predecessor of NTP in regular operation.</description>

      <description>The following changes are in the version 3-5.85 distribution relative to the previous 3.5f version.
  The automatic build procedure has been replaced with GNU autoconfigure. This should make porting to nonstandard machines and operating systems much easier and should simplify the maintenance for multi-architecture sites. See the ./WHERE-TO- START/, ./INSTALL and ./README files for a brief overview of the new building and installing procedures. See the building and installing pages in the HTML documentation for further information.</description>

 xntp3 compiles now again on AIX. I have disabled prototyping and added the switch -D_NO_PROTO which disables prototyping in the system include files.
Matthias Ernst
 xntp version 3 now supports the cc compiler for AIX. The Config.aix will now use cc by default. You can still compile xntp with the bsd compiler by changing COMP= cc to COMP= bsdcc and removing the -DSTUPID_SIGNAL option from the DEFS option.</description>

      <description>Older SCO Unix versions NTP 4.0.x does not run on SCO Unix prior to version 3.2.5.0.0. If you need NTP on an older SCO Unix system and don&amp;rsquo;t mind modifying your kernel, use 3.5.91 which has patches for SCO Unix 3.2.4.x.
 Compiling NTP Delete the old SCO supplied NTP programs using the custom utility. Run the NTP configure program with CFLAGS=&amp;quot;-b elf -K processor-type&amp;quot; for best results.
 Running NTP Run tickadj -As after every reboot to set the variables clock_drift and track_rtc to the right values.</description>

The clock on a sun4u drifts unacceptably. On a typical 143 mHz Ultra, the clock took 1.0001350 seconds to count 1 second. While this may seem trivial, it adds up quickly. In this case, the TOD chip will have to pull the clock forward by 2 seconds every 4 hours and 7 minutes.</description>

This clock has proven a reliable source of time, except in some cases of high ambient conductive RF interference. The claimed accuracy of the clock is 100 usec relative to the broadcast signal; however, in most cases the actual accuracy is limited by the precision of the timecode and the latencies of the serial interface and operating system.</description>

      <description>Notes on CPU clock oscillator tolerance with SunOS 4.1.1 and 4.1.3 A bug in SunOS 4.1.1 results in the kernel time losing 1 microsecond per tick of the system clock. The bug was fixed (bugid 1094383) for SunOS 4.1.1 and corrected in SunOS 4.1.3. The easiest way to fix this is to replace the 4.1.1 binary clock.o with the corresponding 4.1.3 binary. Without this change it is necessary to use the tickadj program included in this distribution with the -t 9999 option.</description>

      <description>The last known Fuzzball (1990)
The Fuzzball The Fuzzball is an operating system and a package of applications for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP11 family of computers, including the LSI-11 board-level components. The package was conceived in 1971 as a replacement for the RAMP operating system for the DEC PDP8 3. It later was evolved as a virtual machine supporting the DEC RT-11 operating system and early developmental versions of the TCP/IP protocol and applications suite.</description>

      <description>In scenarios where a considerable amount of data are downloaded or uploaded using DSL or telephone modem lines, timekeeping quality can be seriously degraded. This occurs because the traffic volume, and thus the queuing delays, on the upload and download directions of transmission can be very different. In many cases the apparent time errors are so large as to exceed the step threshold and a step correction can occur during and after the data transfer.</description>

      <description>Creating a port for vxWorks posed some problems. This port may help as a starting point for similar ports to real-time operating systems and other embeddable kernels, particularly where main() is not allowed, and where the configure scripts need to be altered.
 Configuration issues I decided to do as little invasive surgery as possible on the NTP code, so I brought the vxWorks header tree in line with the standard Unix tree.</description>

      <description>For many years, the NTP source code was kept in a frequently-backed-up directory on a machine. The only &amp;ldquo;snapshots&amp;rdquo; we had of previous releases were whatever tarballs we kept of previous releases. In early &amp;lsquo;99, Harlan and Dave came to an agreement about how a code repository would have to behave and Harlan was finally able to import the codebase into CVS (knowing full well what the limitations of CVS were).</description>

      <description>Introduction The NTP 4 distribution runs as service on Windows 2000 and later. It will NOT run on Windows 95, 98, ME, etc. Lately it has been run the most on Windows-7 and later. The binaries work on multi-processor systems. This port has not been tested on the Alpha platform. This release now uses OpenSSL for authentication. A ready-to-run install distribution is available from Meinberg.
Users should note that the stock Windows client sends requests as mode-1 packets, which can have unintended consequences and create a security risk.</description>

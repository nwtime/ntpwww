In 1896 Herman Hollerith organized the Tabulating Machines Company, which grew in subsequent mergers to become the IBM of today. The Hollerith punched card was the principal means for recording, accounting and archiving functions, not to mention the US census, until recently. In the early 1960&amp;rsquo;s Hollerith cards were the only practical means to input programs for a IBM mainframe, but today these cards are seldom seen.</description></item><item><title>Autokey Identity Schemes</title><link>https://doc.ntp.org/reflib/ident/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://doc.ntp.org/reflib/ident/</guid><description>Maya glyph alautun

The computing system used for that demonstration was called the Fuzzball. As it happened, this was also the first Internet multimedia presentation and the first to use NTP in regular operation.

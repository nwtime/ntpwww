      <description>------------- INTRODUCTION: ------------- Last revision: 06-Jul-1994 Included in this distribution of XNTP V3 is a configuration file suitable for use under Apple&#39;s A/UX Version 3.x.x There is also one for A/UX 2.0.1 but it has not been fully tested. To make the executables follow the steps outlined below. *** NOTE: You must have gcc installed to successfully compile the current distribution; the native cc supplied with A/UX will NOT correctly compile this source.</description>

      <description>Problem with recent ANSI compilers On some systems, including AIX, the compiler quits on the ntp_refclock.c file when processing the refclock_report() routine. The problem, which is eithre a feature or a bug, has to do with an unwanted promotion of the u_char argument to an int and a failure of the compiler to recognize the preceding prototype. A workaround is to use ANSI syntax to delare the arguments. Since ANSI compilers are not universally available, this syntax can&#39;t be used in the stock distribution.</description>

      <description>Author:	Bdale Garbee, bdale@gag.com Last revision:	27Oct94 (Paul Vixie) Included in this distribution of XNTP is a configuration file suitable for use with BSDI&#39;s BSD/OS 1.1 (formerly BSD/386 1.1). On this system, the &#34;cc&#34; command is GCC 1.4x rather than PCC or GCC 2.x. It is imperative that &#34;cc&#34; be used since it predefines the symbol __bsdi__; if you want to use another compiler you will need to add -D__bsdi__ to catch the various #ifdef&#39;s required for this system.</description>

      <description>Some major changes were necessary to make xntp v3 run on the DEC Alpha hardware running DEC OSF/1. All &#34;long&#34; and &#34;u_long&#34; declarations and casts in the code were changed to &#34;LONG&#34; and &#34;U_LONG&#34; and a new header file (include/ntp_types.h) was added. The new header file defines LONG as int and U_LONG as u_int for the Alpha hardware and as long and u_long for anything else. A couple of #ifs where changed in ntpq and xntpdc to get the result of a signal defined correctly.</description>

      <description>If you are compiling under FreeBSD and see messages in the syslogs that indicate that the ntpd process is trying to use unavailable sched_ calls, it means you are running a kernel that does not have the POSIX scheduling calls enabled. You have two choices: - Ignore the messages - Generate a new kernel, where the kernel configuration file contains the lines: options	&#34;P1003_1B&#34; options	&#34;_KPOSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING&#34; options	&#34;_KPOSIX_VERSION=199309L&#34;  </description>

      <description>Last update: Sun Mar 13 15:05:31 PST 1994 This file hopefully describes the whatever and however of how to get xntp running on hpux 7.0 and later: s300, s400, s700, and s800. First off, all the standard disclaimers hold here ... HP doesn&#39;t have anthing to do with this stuff. I fool with it in my spare time because we use it and because I like to. We just happen to have a lot of HP machines around here :-) Xntpd has been in use here for several years and has a fair amount of mileage on various HP platforms within the company.</description>

      <description>HP e3000 MPE/iX NTP Hints - May 29, 2001 ---------------------------------------- NTP was first ported to MPE several years ago, but those diffs were never submitted back to the official NTP distribution. For more information about that deprecated port, please see http://www.bixby.org/mark/xntpix.html. NTP was re-ported to MPE in May 2001. What follows are hints learned from working with NTP 4.0.99k23. For additional information about NTP on MPE, please see http://jazz.external.hp.com/src/hp_freeware/ntp/. MPE lacks the clock-related APIs expected by NTP, so adjtime(), gettimeofday(), and settimeofday() all had to be implemented from scratch by calling privileged, undocumented internal OS functions.</description>

The protocol machinery operates in conformance with the RFC1305 NTP Version 3 specification. The most visible characteristic of this version is that the poll intervals for all polls, even selected ones, is significantly increased. This is especially desirable when serving a large client population. This implementation supports previous versions as non-configured peers; for version-2 configured peers a &#34;</description>

      <description>This is a short overview for the reference clocks currently supported by xntp V3. (Ultimate wisdom can be obtained from xntpd/refclock_*.c this file was derived from that information - unfortunately some comments in the files tend to get stale - so use with caution). Refclock address	Type 127.127.0.x	no clock (fails to configure) 127.127.1.x	local clock - use local clock as reference 127.127.2.x	no clock (fails to configure) 127.127.3.x	PSTI 1010/1020 WWV Clock 127.</description>

      <description>15.7.1993 xntp3 compiles now again on AIX. I have disabled prototyping and added the switch -D_NO_PROTO which disables prototyping in the system include files. Matthias Ernst maer@nmr.lpc.ethz.ch -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Xntp version 3 now support the cc compiler for AIX. The Config.aix will now use cc by default. You can still compile xntp with the bsd compiler by changing &#34;COMP= cc&#34; to &#34;COMP= bsdcc&#34; and removing the &#34;-DSTUPID_SIGNAL&#34; option from the &#34;DEFS&#34; option.</description>

 Older SCO Unix versions NTP 4.0.x does not run on SCO Unix prior to version 3.2.5.0.0. If you need NTP on an older SCO Unix system and don&amp;rsquo;t mind to modify your kernel, use 3.5.91 which has patches for SCO Unix 3.2.4.x.
 Compiling NTP Delete the old SCO supplied NTP programs using the &amp;ldquo;custom&amp;rdquo; utility. Run the NTP configure program with CFLAGS=&amp;quot;-b elf -K _processor-type_&amp;quot; for best results.</description>

      <description>adjtime, tick and tickadj: -------------------------- The SGI value for HZ is 100 under Irix 4, with the system clock running in nominal mode (ftimer off), so the value for tick is 10000 usec. Tickadj is a bit more tricky because of the behaviour of adjtime(), which seems to try to perform the correction over 100-200 seconds, with a rate limit of 0.04 secs/sec for large corrections. Corrections of less than 0.</description>

      <description>Bug Id: 4023118 Category: kernel Subcategory: other State: integrated Synopsis: sun4u doesn&#39;t keep accurate time Description: [ bmc, 12/20/96 ] The clock on a sun4u drifts unacceptably. On a typical 143 mHz Ultra, the clock took 1.0001350 seconds to count 1 second. While this may seem trivial, it adds up quickly. In this case, the TOD chip will have to pull the clock forward by 2 seconds every 4 hours and 7 minutes.</description>

The only place it is set is in the ntp_adjtime system call, from the &#39;constant&#39; element of the timex structure argument.</description>

There are some new files as well: xntp	shell script that starts up ntp during boot up (the packaging stuff creates links to it so it comes up at run level 2). As with all svr4 start/stop scripts, it takes one parameter which is either start or stop.</description>

      <description>Notes on CPU clock oscillator tolerance with SunOS 4.1.1 and 4.1.3 A bug in SunOS 4.1.1 results in the kernel time losing 1 microsecond per tick of the system clock. The bug was fixed (bugid 1094383) for SunOS 4.1.1 and corrected in SunOS 4.1.3. The easiest way to fix this is to replace the 4.1.1 binary clock.o with the corresponding 4.1.3 binary. Without this change it is necessary to use the tickadj program included in this distribution with the -t 9999 option.</description>

      <description>Ulrich Windl : Any change in a source file in the lib directory causes all files to be recompiled (because the objects are removed). Add a better rule for make to update the library. Maybe just remove &#34;-rm -f $?&#34;.  </description>

Creating a port for vxWorks posed some problems. This port may help as a starting point for similar ports to real-time OS&amp;rsquo;s and other embeddable kernels, particularly where main() is not allowed, and where the configure scripts need to be altered.
 Configuration issues I decided to do as little invasive surgery as possible on the NTP code, so I brought the vxWorks header tree in line with the standard Unix tree.</description>

      <description>Introduction The NTP 4 distribution runs as service on Windows 2000 and later. It will NOT run on Windows 95, 98, ME, etc. Lately it has been run the most on Windows-7 and later. The binaries work on multi-processor systems. This port has not been tested on the Alpha platform. This release now uses OpenSSL for authentication. IPv6 is not implemented yet for Win32 platforms. A ready-to-run install distribution is available from Meinberg at http://www.</description>

This file hopefully describes the whatever and however of how to get xntp
running on hpux 7.0 and later: s300, s400, s700, and s800.  

First off,  all the standard disclaimers hold here ... HP doesn't have anthing
to do with this stuff.  I fool with it in my spare time because we use it and
because I like to.  We just happen to have a lot of HP machines around here :-)
Xntpd has been in use here for several years and has a fair amount of mileage
on various HP platforms within the company.  I can't really guarantee bug fixes
but I'd certainly like to hear about bugs and I won't hestitate to look at
any fixes sent to me.  

Now lets talk OS.  If you don't have 7.0 or later, pretty much hang it up now.
This stuff has run here on pretty much everything from 8.0 upward on s300, 
s700, and s800.  It is known to run on 7.0 s300/s400 but all reports are 
from the field and not my personal experience.

If you are lucky enough to have a s300 or s400 with 9.03, then you no longer
have to worry about adjtimed as HP-UX now has adjtime(2).  The rest of you
will have to wait on 10.0 which will have adjtime(2) and a supported though
a bit older version of xntpd.

Next, let me explain a bit about how this stuff works on HP-UX's that do not
have adjtime(2).  The directory adjtime contains libadjtime.a and the adjtimed
daemon.  Instead of the adjtime(2) system call, we use a library routine to
talk to adjtimed thru message queues.  Adjtimed munges into /dev/kmem and
causes the clock to skew properly as needed.  PLEASE NOTE that the adjtime
code provided here is NOT a general replacement for adjtime(2) ... use of
this adjtime(3)/adjtimed(8) other than with xntpd may yield very odd results.

What to do to get this stuff running ?

    * If you are running an OS less than 10.0 or do not have a s300/s400 
      with 9.03 or better
	-> cd machines
	-> vi hpux
	-> (change -DSYS_HPUX=? to match whatever you are running [7,8,9])
	-> cd ..

    * Say "make makeconfig"

    * Say "make", sit back for a few minutes.

    * cd authstuff
	* Say "./authcert < certdata" and check the output.  Every line should
	  end with "OK" ... if not, we got trouble.
	* Now try "./authspeed auth.samplekeys".  What we want to 
	  remember here is the "authentication delay in CPU time" 
	* cd ..

    * Say "make install"

    * I'd suggest reading the xntp docs about now :-) ... seriously !!

    * One thing I have added to this version of xntpd is a way to select 
      config files if you are sharing /usr/local thru NFS or whatever.  
      If the file /usr/local/etc/xntp.conf happens to be a directory, the 
      files in that directory are searched until a match is found.  The 
      rules for a match are:

	1. Our hostname
	2. default.<machine id> (as in default.375 or default.850)
	3. default

    * Ok, make sure adjtimed is running (just start it up for now with
      "/usr/local/etc/adjtimed").  Using -z as an option will get you 
      a usage message.

    * Now start up xntpd and watch it work.

    * Make sure that adjtimed gets started at boot right before xntpd.
      We do this in /etc/netbsdsrc.  They must both run as root !!

Possible problems ?

    * On some 320's and 835's we have had to run adjtimed with "-p 45" or
      so to get rid of syslog messages about "last adjust did not finish".

    * At 9.0, there is a problem with DIAGMON (patch available from the
      response center) which causes it to delete the message queue that
      adjtimed/xntpd use to communicate. (see next note for result)

    * Xntpd has been known to get really ticked off when adjtime() fails
      which is usually only while running the emulation code on HP-UX.
      When it gets mad, it usually jumps the clock into never never land.
      Possible reasons for this are adjtimed being killed or just never
      started or adjtimed being completely swapped out on a really busy
      machine (newer adjtimed try to lock themselves in memory to prevent
      this one).

Dave,
   After reading the hpux hints file, I realized I didn't install or 
start adjtimed.  In the course of doing this, I discovered that:

--> $(TOP) is not defined in adjtime/Makefile, so "make install" can't
    find the install.sh script.

--> "make install" from the main Makefile never goes into the adjtime
    directory, so I added the following two lines into the install
    target of the main Makefile:

    @echo installing from adjtime
    @cd adjtime && $(MAKE) $(MFLAGS) MFLAGS="$(MFLAGS)" MAKE="$(MAKE)" install

This twiddle may not be right for all systems, but it got adjtimed
installed for me.

   You might also want to add to the hpux hints file that one way to
fire things up at boot time is to add the following lines to the localrc
function of /etc/rc:

    #---daemons for Network Time Protocol (version 3.4s)
    #---note that adjtimed is only needed for HP-UX 9.X, not 10.0
    #---adjtimed must be running or xntpd won't work right...
    if [ -x /usr/local/bin/adjtimed ]; then
        /usr/local/bin/adjtimed -r & echo -n ' adjtimed'
        if [ -x /usr/local/bin/xntpd ]; then
            /usr/local/bin/xntpd &    echo -n ' xntpd'
        fi
    fi

I discovered that the "-r" option of adjtimed is needed to clear out any
trash from a previous execution of it.  Otherwise adjtimed quietly dies
and leaves xntpd in the lurch...

Thanks for the help.

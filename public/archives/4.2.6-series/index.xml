Most modern software distributions include an autoconfigure utility which customizes the build and install configuration according to the specific hardware, operating system and file system conventions. For NTP this utility is called configure, which is run before building and installing the program components.

The ntpq and ntpdc utility programs can be used to debug reference clocks, either on the server itself or from another machine elsewhere in the network. The server is compiled, installed and started using the configuration file described in the ntpd page and its dependencies. If the clock appears in the ntpq utility and pe command, no errors have occurred and the daemon has started, opened the devices specified and waiting for peers and radios to come up.</description></item><item><title>Event Messages and Status Words</title><link>https://doc.ntp.org/archives/4.2.6-series/decode/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://doc.ntp.org/archives/4.2.6-series/decode/</guid><description>from Alice&amp;rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll

The NTPv4 implementation includes provisions for an external clock, where the system clock is implemented by some external hardware device. One implementation might take the form of a bus peripheral with a high resolution counter disciplined by a GPS receiver, for example. Another implementation might involve another synchronization protocol, such as the Digital Time Synchronization Service (DTSS), where the system time is disciplined to this protocol and NTP clients of the server obtain synchronization indirectly via the server.</description></item><item><title>Gadget Box PPS Level Converter and CHU Modem</title><link>https://doc.ntp.org/archives/4.2.6-series/gadget/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://doc.ntp.org/archives/4.2.6-series/gadget/</guid><description>A Gadget Box built by Chuck Hanavin
Many radio clocks used as a primary reference source for NTP servers produce a pulse-per-second (PPS) signal that can be used to improve accuracy to a high degree. However, the signals produced are usually incompatible with the modem interface signals on the serial ports used to connect the signal to the host. The gadget box consists of a handful of electronic components assembled in a small aluminum box.</description></item><item><title>Hints and Kinks</title><link>https://doc.ntp.org/archives/4.2.6-series/hints/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://doc.ntp.org/archives/4.2.6-series/hints/</guid><description>from Alice&amp;rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll

broadcastdelay seconds The broadcast and multicast modes require a special calibration to determine the network delay between the local and remote servers. Ordinarily, this is done automatically by the initial protocol exchanges between the client and server.

Table of Contents Introduction PPSAPI Application Program Interface Introduction RFC-2783 describes the PPSAPI application programming interface for external precision time signals, such as the pulse-per-second (PPS) signal generated by some radio clocks and cesium oscillators. The PPSAPI provides a generic capability in the ubiquitous Unix kernel which can be used for a wide variety of measurement applications, including network time synchronization and related experiments.</description></item><item><title>Pulse-Per-Second (PPS) Signal Interfacing</title><link>https://doc.ntp.org/archives/4.2.6-series/pps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://doc.ntp.org/archives/4.2.6-series/pps/</guid><description>from Alice&amp;rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll

Table of Contents Introduction Gadget Box Operating System Support PPS Driver Using the Pulse-per-Second (PPS) Signal Introduction Most radio clocks are connected using a serial port operating at speeds of 9600 bps. The accuracy using typical timecode formats, where the on-time epoch is indicated by a designated ASCII character like carriage-return &amp;lt;cr&amp;gt;, is normally limited to 100 microseconds.</description></item><item><title>Quick Start</title><link>https://doc.ntp.org/archives/4.2.6-series/quick/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://doc.ntp.org/archives/4.2.6-series/quick/</guid><description>FAX test image for SATNET (1979).
The baby panda was scanned at University College London and used as a FAX test image for a demonstration of the DARPA Atlantic SATNET Program and the first transatlantic Internet connection in 1978. The computing system used for that demonstration was called the Fuzzball. As it happened, this was also the first Internet multimedia presentation and the first to use a predecessor of NTP in regular operation.</description></item><item><title>Rate Management and the Kiss-o'-Death Packet</title><link>https://doc.ntp.org/archives/4.2.6-series/rate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://doc.ntp.org/archives/4.2.6-series/rate/</guid><description>from Pogo, Walt Kelly

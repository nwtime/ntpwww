% Abstract/logical time/clocks:

<a href="http://www.tno.nl/instit/fel/refs/pub96_nl.html"> an article
(Word for Windows 6.0)</a> can be found about Time Synchronization
in Distributed Interactive Simulations. Part of it is a stepwise
description on how to installe and configure NTP.
NTP was used to synchronize systems across the ocean using ISDN-links.

The article has been written by IST, TNO-FEL and VEDA.

This repository contains the source code for the website of the [Network Time Protocol (NTP) Project](https://www.ntp.org/).

Website content is written in [extended markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is used to generate the HTML. A framework is available for translations; contact [webmaster](mailto:webmaster@nwtime.org) if you are interested in working on a translation.

Website content is located in `content/en` as follows:
* `dev`: Content for NTP developers. These pages were converted to markdown from the [Dev Wiki](https://support.ntp.org/Dev). Work is ongoing to finish converting that content and retire that wiki.
* `documentation`: The NTP documentation, per version. This includes the handbook, man pages, drivers, and hints.
* `ntpfaq`: The NTP FAQ.
* `reflib`: Historical content from Dave Mills' NTP pages at the University of Delaware. This includes his briefs, memos, papers, reports, and RFCs.
* `support`: Pages converted to markdown from the [Support Wiki](https://support.ntp.org/Support). Work is ongoing to finish converting that content and retire that wiki.
